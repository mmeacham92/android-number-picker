# My first steps into the world of Android development!

- This project is the first of 4 built during Rahul Pandey's CS194A Android Development course on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7NYbSE8uaBDcLkbXsQADdvBnVbavonGn)

- This application displays two button widgets to a user and instructs the user to click the button which represent the larger of two numbers. If the user selects the correct button, the background will change to a certain color and a Toast will display "Correct!". Otherwise the background will change to a different color and a Toast will display "Incorrect!". After a button is pressed, new random values will be assigned to each button.
